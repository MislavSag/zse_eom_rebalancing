  title={Stock Market Efficiency in the Transition Economies through the Lens of Calendar Anomalies},
  author={Heininen, Polina and Puttonen, Vesa},
  year={2008},
  abstract={Calendar regularities that challenge the Efficient Market Hypothesis are widely explored phenomena in the advanced economies. However, there is little research concerning the prevalence of these anomalies in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) states. This study provides empirical evidence on market efficiency and day-of-the-week, month-of-the-year, turn-of-the-month and Halloween effects in twelve transition economies. The results indicate that the CEE-countries stock markets are weakly efficient in terms of day-of-the-week and month-of-the-year anomalies. The turn-of-the-month effect is detected in Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. In these countries the average 5-day turn-of-the-month yield accounts for 85% of the monthly return. Trading strategy based on the Halloween effect produces statistically significant abnormal returns in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia. In general, calendar anomalies show signs of declination throughout the sample period and the market efficiency increases gradually in all examined countries.},
